# Financial Data Visualization and Analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNN)

This project uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze and visualize financial data. Stock data is modeled as a graph, where nodes represent individual stocks, and edges represent relationships (e.g., correlations). The model predicts stock movement trends and visualizes data interactively for financial analysis.

## Features
- **Data Modeling:** Represent stocks as graph nodes and their relationships as edges.
- **Visualization:** Generate heatmaps and interactive graphs to explore stock data.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Utilize GNN models to forecast stock trends based on relationships.
